    <h1>Exercise 2 : HTML Form #2</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <!--Using the same form structure as Exercise 1. -->

    <form action="" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="Yasser"><br><br>

        <label for="comments">Comments</label><br>
        <textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows="4" cols="50">Hello this is a comment</textarea><br><br>

        <input type="submit" value="Send">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

<!--When you click the "Send" button with the POST method:

1. The form data will NOT appear in the URL (unlike with GET).

2. The data is sent in the body of the HTTP request.

3. To view the sent data:

        Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)

        Go to the "Network" tab

        Submit the form

        Look for the request (usually the first entry or named after your HTML file)

        Click on the request and go to the "Headers" section

        Scroll down to "Form Data" or "Request Payload" to see the submitted data

The Network tab will show you:

        The request method (POST)

        The content-type (usually application/x-www-form-urlencoded)

        The form data in the request body (name=John&comments=Hello+this+is+a+comment)

Since we're using the same HTML file as the action URL, the page will reload but won't display 
the submitted data unless you add server-side code to process it.-->
